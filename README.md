## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I built this landing page to strengthen my skills in semantic HTML and the CSS grid.

With this project I have learned a little more about how to make a responsive page in a more elastic way and not depend on rigid media queries to change the appearance according to the devices

### Continued development

This project is practical, so it is completed and will begin with others so I can continue mastering the fundamentals before getting back on track to using frameworks in larger projects.
